# Kahzum - A startup for brick and mortar small businesses

## Overview
- **Date:** 2018-2022

## Description
Kahzum is an entrepreneurial project originally founded in an entrepreneurship class in 2018 with 3 other teammates on a mission to empower small business owners to better understand their business. In our struggle to find product market fit, we have gone through several iterations of products (initially, we started with ads on cars, but quickly figured out that that was cost prohibitive to a small business) but have for now landed on tracking changes in traffic for small businesses so they can better allocate their resources and measure how changes in their store affect how many people come in the door.
Overall, Kahzum has been my first real foray into entrepreneurship and I have enjoyed it immensely. In winter of 2019, we had the opportunity to pitch Kahzum to a bunch of people as a part of [Launchpad Propel by Blackstone and Techstars](http://events.techstars.com/blackstone-launchpad-propel). It was my first opportunity to pitch in front of a large crowd and it was honestly quite nerve wracking. But we did it and as a result got a free trip to NYC, funded by UC Santa Cruz.

## Key Contributions
- **Team Management and Direction**: As the CEO and cofounder of Kahzum, I was responsible for making sure that we were on track and utilizing everybody's skills effectively.
- **Pitching/Fundraising**: I pitched/presented Kahzum in it's various iterations a few times and successfully raised some money for the company. It wasn't a ton but it was enough to fully cover our expenses
- **Routing Application**: This was one of the final iterations of Kahzum - we were doing same-day delivery for small businesses who were hit hard by the pandemic. This application was built by me and handled the logistics of finding an optimal route to deliver all the packages in a given day.
