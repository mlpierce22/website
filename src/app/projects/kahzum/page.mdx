# Kahzum

## Overview
- **Date:** 2018-2022

## Description
Kahzum was an entrepreneurial venture I co-founded in 2018 during an entrepreneurship class, aimed at helping small brick and mortar business owners understand their businesses better. Initially starting with car ads, we quickly pivoted due to the high costs for small businesses. We eventually focused on tracking customer traffic changes for these businesses, aiding them in resource allocation and understanding the impact of store modifications. Our final iteration, spawned by the pandemic, was a same-day delivery service for small businesses. This was successful but not scalable.

My experience with Kahzum marked my first serious engagement with entrepreneurship, which I found highly rewarding. In the winter of 2019, we had the chance to pitch Kahzum at [Launchpad Propel by Blackstone and Techstars](https://events.techstars.com/blackstone-launchpad-propel) in NYC. Presenting to a large audience and investors was daunting, and something I honestly struggled with a lot. Regardless, it was a good learning experience for us.


## Key Contributions
- **Team Management and Direction**: As the CEO and cofounder of Kahzum, I was responsible for making sure that we were on track and utilizing everybody's skills effectively.
- **Pitching/Fundraising**: I pitched/presented Kahzum in it's various iterations a few times and successfully raised some money for the company. It wasn't a ton but it was enough to fully cover our expenses
- **Routing Application**: This was one of the final iterations of Kahzum - we were doing same-day delivery for small businesses who were hit hard by the pandemic. This application was built by me and handled the logistics of finding an optimal route to deliver all the packages in a given day.

## Challenges and Solutions
I think one of the main difficulties with Kahzum was that we were all students and had other commitments. On top of that, we were all relatively inexperienced and learning as we went. In addition to that, small businesses have an _extremely_ limited budget for new technologies. We found that the best pitch was saving time or energy, but even then, we found that business owners didn't value their time as money, so it was hard to build the business case when they just said "well yeah it takes time, but I could just do it myself".
