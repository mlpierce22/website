- **Live Link:** [Visit Website](https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/)

## Description
When I began working in the Tech4Good lab during Winter Quarter of my freshman year, the lab was small (~5 students). Through the time I was there, the lab has experienced explosive growth and as of Spring, 2020, there were 44 lab members (now there are well over 200). Originally, the website built by David (the professor in charge of the Tech4good Lab) in the traditional academic fashion. That is, it was geared towards impressing academics bringing in grant money. It quickly became apparent that the traditional approach to the website was not the right fit for a lab that was directly challenging the way in which research is typically conducted. So, after a summer of design work, followed by another quarter of development, the new and improved [Tech4Good Website](https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/) was launched.

## My Contributions
During fall quarter (2019), I was tasked with taking the designs that had been made over the summer and turning them into a real website. That meant generating components (in the typical Angular fashion), defining inputs and outputs for each component, and defining types, structures and actual sample data that would go into the firebase database in the future. In building the container (what we call the "smart component"), I utilized rxjs to manipulate observables so they would contain the correct information for a given component so that the site would be easily scaled to have more dynamic items like, for example, profile pages and ways to customize them so that lab members can have a personalized experience.

Once everything was set up, I opened issues and organized a Github project board so that my team could efficiently execute on the construction of the site. As the quarter went on, I was in charge of helping my team of 4 learn web development (most of them were fairly new to it) so that they could style and bind the components I had set up to help them solidify their knowledge.

Originally, there was no real rush for the site, but during week 5, David was notified that he was selected to give a Tedx talk (He did a really good job explaining the "why" of the lab. I highly recommend checking it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiagYDwv40Q)!) and he suddenly needed the website production ready before that talk. Now in crunch time, my team worked hard to get the site out. Just two days before the Tedx Talk, I put the finishing touches and missing styles on the site before sending it to David for a final review. After some final revisions, the site went live at 2am the night before the Tedx talk. Talk about cutting it close.

## Lessons Learned
I think the most important part of this for me was learning how to lead a team of developers - especially when those developers are not getting paid and are doing it for the experience. I learned how to motivate people and how to help them learn. From a personal development standpoint, I was able to practice the complexities of breaking down a large projects into chunks that could be worked on by multiple people in parallel.
