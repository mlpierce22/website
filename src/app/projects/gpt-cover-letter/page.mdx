## Purpose
Cover Letter Composer was developed to automate the process of writing cover letters for job applications. It matches the user's relevant skills to specific job descriptions, ensuring each letter is tailored and formatted according to the user's preferences. In my case, the first draft is the hardest part, so that's what this does for me.

## Target Audience
Job seekers who frequently apply to various positions and require customized cover letters that effectively align their skills with the job requirements.

## Functionality
The tool analyzes the job description provided by the user and cross-references it with their skillset and experience. It then generates a cover letter that highlights the most relevant qualifications in a preferred format, ensuring each application is unique and well-tailored.

## Data Usage
Leverages user-inputted job descriptions and personal professional information (such as skills, experiences, and achievements) to create a cover letter that is both personalized and relevant to the job being applied for.

## Unique Features
Its unique capability lies in its precision in matching skills to job descriptions and in customizing the layout and tone of the cover letter to suit individual user preferences, making each submission distinctive and engaging.
