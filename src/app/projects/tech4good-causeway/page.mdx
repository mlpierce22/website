# Causeway: Learning Through Micro-role Heirarchies

## Overview
- **Date:** 2018-2020
- **Technologies Used:** Angular, Rxjs, Typescript, HTML, CSS

## Description
Throughout my time in the Tech4good Lab, I have worked on development for numerous projects, but I have invested most of my time in the development of Causeway, the lab's flagship platform. Causeway is built to teach the highly applicable skill of web development (regardless of whether or not the user has a computer science background) while simultaneously contributing to a real world project for a community cause (like a non-profit). Through Causeway, we hope to redefine the typical learning experience to more closely represent that of a workplace, where most learning occurs while building whatever product the company needs built. A paper published about Causeway's micro-role hierarchy and scaling situated learning won [best paper honorable mention](https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/assets/docs/chi-2019-ca.pdf) and there is another paper in the works more around the effectiveness of "doing-by-learning" (i.e. building something as you learn).

## Key Contributions
I worked on Causeway since the Fall of 2018, contributing significantly to its development, strategic planning, design iteration, and user testing. My key contributions involved collaborating with David, the professor leading the Tech4good Lab, to plan core interfaces, develop and maintain the Stackblitz interface, create learning examples on GitHub, and conduct usability testing. I led a team for final preparations before a major beta release to David's CSE 175 class, which included approximately 155 students, and addressed issues during the launch.

### Classroom vs. Studio: Causeway's Core Interfaces
As a research fellow in the Tech4good lab in summer 2019, I collaborated with David, another fellow, and a PhD student to define Causeway's research question. We agreed to test the efficacy of doing-by-learning versus traditional learning by incorporating both methods in Causeway. I co-designed the interfaces for the "Classroom" and "Studio" sections. The Classroom was developed for traditional learning and included a feature to show users "answers" for learning purposes, utilizing Stackblitz's in-browser IDE. We tackled several challenges in integrating Stackblitz, ensuring a smooth user experience despite its unreliability (detailed in Stackblitz Services for Reliability and Performance Improvements).

### Stackblitz Services for Reliability and Performance Improvements
Assigned to enhance Stackblitz's reliability, I developed "services" in Angular to embed Stackblitz instances into Causeway. These services managed error handling and user code saving, significantly improving performance and user experience. The services successfully supported around 150 students in CSE 175, with 90% encountering no major problems.

### Scripting with the Github API
For the Classroom component of Causeway, users followed a step-by-step workflow, requiring a start and end point for coding steps. We used Stackblitz to embed these steps from specific commit shas on GitHub. After identifying inefficiencies in tracking and updating commit shas, I created a Typescript script utilizing the GitHub API to automate the process, enhancing scalability and reducing human error.

### Usability (UX) Testing
Since summer 2019, I've conducted regular usability tests on Causeway. In fall 2019, I led a team to test the Classroom interface, combining QA and UX methodologies. We observed users, conducted post-test interviews, and assessed issues based on their severity. These findings were then used to create and prioritize issues on GitHub for ongoing improvements.

## Credits and Acknowledgements
Mostly to David Lee for giving me this experience, but also to the other students around me who helped me learn and grow as a developer and a person.
