# About Me
## In the Tech World
I started in tech by modding Minecraft, leading to a Computer Science degree with a minor in Technology Information Management from UC Santa Cruz. During my time in school, I was involved in entrepreneurship clubs, worked as the cofounder of a business catering to the challenges of running a small business in Santa Cruz ([Kahzum](/projects)), and was a Fellow/Lead in the Tech4Good lab. See a quick timeline below:

I spent 9 years of my life (freshman year of high school to one year out of college) studying and practicing pole vault. I absolutely love this sport and everything it has given me - from accolates to very valuable life lessons about the fragility of confidence and importance of being uncomfortable. The community around it is also fantastic - the coolest people you will ever meet will be pole vaulters. As a result, I plan to come back and coach at some point in the future.
