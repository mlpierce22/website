# About Me
## In the Tech World 
I started in tech by modding Minecraft, leading to a Computer Science degree with a minor in Technology Information Management from UC Santa Cruz. During my time in school, I was involved in entrepreneurship clubs, worked as the cofounder of a business catering to the challenges of running a small business in Santa Cruz ([Kahzum](/projects)), and was a Fellow/Lead in the Tech4Good lab. Upon graduating, I joined [Camio](https://camio.com) full time as a sofware engineer.

 See a quick timeline below:
 
    {/* TODO: Make interactive */}

* **March 2018**: Convinced David to let me join the Tech4Good lab, started working on [Causeway](/projects). Founded Kahzum to help small businesses in Santa Cruz.
* **September 2017**: Started as a freshman at UC Santa Cruz, tried to join the Tech4Good lab, but was rejected. Instead, I ended up being a grader for TIM 80L where [I wrote a script](https://github.com/mlpierce22/TIM-80L-Scripts-for-Grading) that automated sending out emails to students as status updates on their grades. 
* **May 2017**: Graduated from Colfax High School

## My Hobbies

### Pole Vaulting

I spent 9 years of my life (freshman year of high school to one year out of college) studying and practicing pole vault. I absolutely love this sport and everything it has given me - from accolades to very valuable life lessons about the fragility of confidence and importance of being uncomfortable. The community around it is also fantastic - the coolest people you will ever meet will be pole vaulters. As a result, I plan to come back and coach at some point in the future.

### Skiing 

I've been skiing since I could walk. I absolutely love it and try to go as much as possible. Usually, during the winter you will find me on a ski trip either with family or friends. Below are some obligatory videos of my skiing prowress:

And of course can't forget this gem:

### Running 

    <LazyMarkdownImage src={CrossCountryRace} alt="Cross Country" caption="Me as a baby - idk if I won" />

I've been running since first grade (I used to run during recess because I'm cool ðŸ˜Ž). I ran cross country throughout middle school and high school. Turns out, you also have to run when you compete in college.

These days, I run for fun and to stay in shape. I'm currently waiting for the price of marathons to go down so I can run one.

### Singing

I sang in chamber choir in high school and concert choir in college in addition to various individual performances across the years.

### Traveling

## What now?
Today, I'm exploring new opportunities post-Camio, particularly in AI, LLMs, and startups (or teams in bigger companies that function like startups). I'm also working on a few side projects, including this website and some LLM based apps that I hope to release soon.
