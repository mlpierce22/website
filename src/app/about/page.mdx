## About Me
### A Little About Me
Away from the keyboard, I'm an avid runner, climber, and skier, and I enjoy singing and traveling. My college days as a pole vaulter taught me the importance of resilience, focus, and teamwork—qualities that I bring into my professional life.

I thrive in environments where collaboration is key. My background in sports has shown me how combining individual strengths can lead to collective success. This belief strongly influences how I approach teamwork in technology projects.


### My Professional Journey
My journey in tech started with modding Minecraft and grew into a career driven by innovation and social impact. At college, I majored in Computer Science and minored in Technology Information Management. During that time, I played an important role in the beginning of the [Tech4good Lab](https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/#/) (I led the team that built the website). During the infamous Covid Summer ™️, I joined Camio as a frontend engineering intern. I loved it so much that I continued through my senior year and joined full time as a software engineer once I graduated.

My philosophy centers on creating software that genuinely solves problems, blending hard work with consistent innovation. Highlights of my career thus far include spearheading initiatives at the Tech4good lab, being an early engineer at Camio and leading key projects. Looking ahead, I'm excited about opportunities in AI and LLMs, particularly in roles that merge technical expertise with impactful leadership.
