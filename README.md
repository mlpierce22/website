Thanks for checking out my personal site! Below are some notes

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Future
What if you had a website where you used RAG for data retrieval of all _your_ data and the interface was basically a text conversation between you and my "persona" to learn about me. I could also have specific things returned that I've pre-prepared like images or interactive elements. This is a bit inspired by this: https://juliangarnier.com/ and other creative portfolios here: https://github.com/iRaul/creative-portfolios
